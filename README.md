## Algorithms

This is a simple project with a collection of different algorithms in Python. I learned most of these algorithms through coursework at UC Riverside and implemented them here for practice.

#### Sorting Algorithms

- Merge Sort

#### Numerics Algorithms

- Recursive Multiplication
- Karatusba Multiplication (Divide & Conquer)

#### Graph Algorithms

- Flood Fill
- Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Disjoint Set Structure

#### Parallel Algorithms

- Sum using Dynamic Parallelization
  - Divide & Conquer Approach (Recursive)
- Sum using Chunking
  - Chunk size based on Available Processors
